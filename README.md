# Programming-Task---Crawl-Issue-Report
This crawler download and parse the issue report on Camel: *https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10597*, then it saves the required data into a .CSV file.<br><br>
However, some items can not be tracked. I guess it's beacuse the website has set some restrictions which hinder the crawling process.<br><br>
The code is written in a limited time. Thus, there are many parts that could be optimized in the future to boost efficiency.<br><br>
Well, I think I need a rest now...
